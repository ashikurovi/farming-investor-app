    title: "Maize Trade",
    project_details:
      "Maize is one of Bangladesh’s most dynamic and profitable crops, fueling the livestock, poultry feed, and food processing industries. Demand continues to rise every year, particularly in regions like Jhenaidah, Dinajpur, and Lalmonirhat, where thousands of smallholder farmers work tirelessly to meet national consumption needs. However, limited access to fair financing, storage facilities, and market linkages often restricts their income potential.\r\n\r\nThe FarmerCare Maize Growth Project gives investors the opportunity to participate in this high-value agricultural cycle while supporting rural farmers. Each investment unit of BDT 15,000 finances the collection, storage, and strategic sale of maize over an 18-month trading cycle. Our approach focuses on purchasing maize directly from verified farmers during harvest season, when prices are lowest, and selling during peak demand to achieve strong profit margins.\r\n\r\nInvestors can expect a 35–40% ROI, with projected returns of BDT 20,250–BDT 21,000 combining both principal and profit, delivered in a single transparent payout at the end of the cycle. FarmerCare’s expert operations team manages procurement, storage, logistics, and sales under a fully auditable financial framework, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the project.\r\n\r\nEvery investment strengthens rural livelihoods by giving farmers access to fair, interest-free capital, modern storage solutions, and technical guidance to improve productivity and reduce post-harvest losses. This creates a win-win: attractive financial returns for investors and sustainable growth for the local agricultural economy.\r\n\r\nBy participating in the Maize Growth Project, you support food security, rural empowerment, and resilient agri-trade networks in Bangladesh — all while earning a meaningful financial return.\r\n\r\n👉 Invest with FarmerCare.

    project_details:
      "Maize is one of Bangladesh’s fastest-growing and most commercially viable crops, supporting the country’s livestock, poultry, and feed industries. Yet, despite strong domestic demand, thousands of smallholder farmers remain unable to unlock the crop’s full potential due to limited access to capital, modern inputs, and market linkages.\r\n\r\nThe Maize Harvest Initiative by FarmerCare is designed to unlock the full potential of maize farming in Bangladesh by connecting smallholder farmers with investors who want to make a measurable difference. Maize is one of the country’s most promising crops, driven by the growing demand from poultry, livestock, and food industries. Yet, most small farmers struggle with access to financing, technology, and secure markets — challenges that limit productivity and profit.\r\n\r\nThrough this initiative, FarmerCare brings together technology, training, and traceability to ensure a complete farm-to-market solution. Each participating farmer receives quality inputs, modern cultivation guidance, and continuous technical support from our agri-expert team. Our digital monitoring tools and farm analytics help minimize risks related to weather, pest attacks, and input misuse, protecting both farmers and investors.\r\n\r\nFor investors, the Maize Harvest Initiative offers a low-risk, high-impact opportunity with transparent financial returns. Bangladesh produces over 5 million metric tons of maize annually, but local demand continues to rise 8–10% each year, ensuring a strong and stable market. On average, participating farmers achieve a 25–35% yield increase and up to 40% higher income, driving both profitability and community development.\r\n\r\nEvery investment made through FarmerCare is fully traceable — from seed purchase to harvest sales. Our integrated platform allows investors to monitor crop progress and receive detailed performance updates in real time. Returns are disbursed directly after product sales through verified supply chain channels, ensuring transparency and timely payouts.",
